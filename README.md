# Run-and-tumble
SciComp Practical and Bachelorwork: Run-and-tumble in a crowded environment: Persistent exclusion process for swimmers

The goal is to simmulate Particles in one and two Dimensions with several rules. At first they move on a cluster. Each 
site can only be occupied by one Particle. Each paricle is caracterized by a label that indicates the Direction of it. 
The Particles move semirandomly. This means, that they prefer one Direction, but also can go into an other. Still it is 
possible, that the preferred direction changes.
